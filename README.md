## Important: Paystack Configuration Required

Before the payment functionality works, you need to:

1. **Get Your Paystack Keys:**
   - Sign up at https://paystack.com if you haven't already
   - Go to Dashboard > Settings > API Keys & Webhooks
   - Copy your **Public Key** (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode)

2. **Update the JavaScript File:**
   - Open `script.js`
   - Find line 2: `const PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY = 'pk_test_your_public_key_here';`
   - Replace `'pk_test_your_public_key_here'` with your actual Paystack public key

## To Test the Website:

### Option 1: Simple File Opening
- Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser
- Note: Payment won't work with file:// protocol, but you can see the design

### Option 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)
If you have Node.js installed:
```bash
npx http-server . -p 8000 -c-1
```

If you have Python installed:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000
